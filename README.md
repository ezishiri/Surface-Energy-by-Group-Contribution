# Surface-Energy-by-Group-Contribution
Using the method outlined in the paper titled "Calculation of Hamaker constant and surface energy of polymers by a simple group contribution method " by Vial, I made simple code that approximates the surface energy of a polymer by the carbon group method outlined in the paper. Not every group in this code however (holes in literature, e.g. carboxyl groups)
